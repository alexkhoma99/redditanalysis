# redditanalysis

Visualizer for reddit user post history. Displays bubble chart of total posts and comments and includes links to subreddits.
Uses Fetch to recursively call reddit API until all data is collected, then D3.js to visualize. 

Thanks to github.com/jsoma for D3 tutorials and github.com/VincentGarreau for particles.js

Currently doesn't work on mobile.
